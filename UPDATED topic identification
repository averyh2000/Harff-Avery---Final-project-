Title: The Yellow Faced Bombus and how the food supply changes seasonly throughout the state of Oregon. 

I am interested in the Yellow Faced Bombus and how the food suppy changes throughout the seasons, also how abundant the food supply is in the changing weather/season. 

Question: 
How does mean temperature of affect the flower population in the summer (june-september)? 
How does the rainfall in Dec-March effect the bees diet?
How does the Yellow Faced Bombus food change with the changing seasons (top 6 plants, bar plot)? 

Data:
  Oregon Bee Atlas; information about where the bee has been-
      https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/57689-Bombus-vosnesenskii
      
  The temperature of each month in Oregon (website shows, average temp,             max/min temp, and percipitation) -
      https://data.citizen-times.com/weather-data/oregon/41/2021-01-01/table/
      
  Diet of the Yellow faced bombus consists of: Blue Hydrangea, Lupinus,                 Eriogonum, Phacelia, Clarkia, and Ericameria
          Lupinus (mid april- june)-         https://www.oregon.gov/oda/shared/Documents/Publications/PlantConservation/LupinusOreganusProfile.pdf
          
Blue Hydrangea -

Eriogonum (june- september, october in higher elevations)                             https://extension.oregonstate.edu/gardening/pollinators/eriogonum-umbellatum-sulphur-flower-buckwheat

Phacelia (april - july) -         https://blogs.oregonstate.edu/gardenecologylab/tag/phacelia/

Clarkia (fall and spring) - https://blogs.oregonstate.edu/gardenecologylab/tag/clarkia-amoena/

Ericameria (june - november) https://oregonflora.org/taxa/garden.php?taxon=4890 and https://oregonflora.org/taxa/index.php?tid=13000 (the second link has a map of the locations)
  
Methods:
- temporal data averages of temperature and percipiation
- Spacial data 
- interaction networks

COMMENTS: 
Not sure what your questions are? should have several questions that can be explored with selected data. 
Need several types of data (spacial, ect...)
