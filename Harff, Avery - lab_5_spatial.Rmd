# Oregon bee atlas data exploration 

Import the OBA data from 2018 and 2019 what you favorite parsing function (in the data folder of this lab's zip, converted to a .csv)

# Excersize 1.1
```{r}

OBA_data18 <- read.csv("data/2018_occurrence.csv")

OBA_data19 <- read.csv("data/2019_occurrence.csv")

```

# Excersize 1.2
It will be cumbersome to deal with each dataframe individually. Are the column names in the identical order
such that you could use `rbind()` (row bind) to bind them together? Some combination of the functions `colnames()`, `identical()`

```{r}
identical(colnames(OBA_data18), colnames(OBA_data19)) 
combo_OBA <- rbind(OBA_data18, OBA_data19)
```

# Excersize 1.3
Find the column related to a specimens species ID. Use `sort()` and `unique()` to print the unique values in alphabetical order.  How many species are there? 

```{r}
order_combo_OBA <- sort(unique(combo_OBA$species)) 

```
```{r}
length(order_combo_OBA)
```

Some specimens are not identified to species, only genus. How is this reflected in the data? 
ANSWER THIS LATER 

# Excersize 1.4
So many bees, so little time. Count up the occurrences of each bee species, and subset the data to bees that have been seen at least two times. 
You can use the tidyverse or any other functions in R that you like. How many species are there? 

```{r}
bees <- subset(order_combo_OBA, order_combo_OBA >= 2)
```

Google a few bee names (that have been seen > 2 times) and find one with an a look that resonates with you.

What is the name of your bee? 
    Andrena prunorum

Import the photos into Rmarkdown below (hint: googling bee name "discover life" or "inat" can often get you a photo. Many bees will no have any photos :( 
![](/Users/averyharff/Desktop/BI 410L Data Sci Ecol Conserv/Andrena_prunorum,_female,_side,I_SD5693.jpeg){alt='Andrena prunorum'}

# Excersize 2.1
How that have chosen your spirit bee, we would like to plot it's distribution. What is the crs of the data? Hint: it is the same as what inat uses because all bees have a georeferenced plant host. If the data is in lat long, it is "unprojected" so only a datum will be listed. 

```{r}
unique(combo_OBA$issue)
#create shape files DATUM_ASSUMED_WGS84
```

# Excersize 2.2. 
Extract the X and Y locations for your species only from the data and create a spatial object. Don't forget to set the CRS! Hint 1: consider what other data you would like to keep as attributes, for example what flower they were foraging on. Hint 2: Remember the lat is y and long is x. 

```{r}

apOBA <- combo_OBA %>% 
          filter(species=="Andrena prunorum") %>% 
          dplyr::select(x = decimalLongitude,y = decimalLatitude, associatedTaxa)


location_apOBA<- st_as_sf(apOBA, coords = c("x", "y"), crs= crs("EPSG:4326"))
              
```

# Excersize 2.3
Plot your exciting bee data!

```{r plot-data-points}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = location_apOBA) +
  ggtitle("Andrena prunorum Location")
```

Not so exciting without some kind of background... 

# Excersize 2.4
Luckily we can download basemaps into R using the map_data function in ggplot (amoung many others). There is an example for retrieving the Oregon county polygons. 

```{r plot-or}
or <- map_data("county", "oregon") %>% 
  select(lon = long, lat, group, id = subregion) 

ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(data = or, aes(x = lon, y = lat, group=group), color = 'darkorchid1', fill = NA) +
  ggtitle("Andrena prunorum Location in Oregon")

```

Add your species's points to your choice or an Oregon basemap. 

```{r plot-data-points-basemap}
#geompolygon aes(group=group )
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = location_apOBA, color='navyblue') +
  geom_polygon(data = or, aes(x = lon, y = lat, group=group), color = 'purple', fill = NA) +
  ggtitle("Andrena prunorum Location in Oregon")


ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = location_apOBA, color='navyblue') +
  geom_polygon(data = or, aes(x = lon, y = lat, group=group), color = 'purple', fill = NA) +
  ggtitle("Andrena prunorum Location in Oregon") 
```
# Excersize 2.5

Here is your moment to explore your cartographic skills. 

* 1. Add another spatial layer relevant to your final project and tweek the Oregon map in anyway that is useful/visually appealing. You may need to crop that layer to the extent of your species's distribution. 

* 2. Color your points according to some data attribute and add a legend (month collected, county, collector, associated plant, whatever you think is interesting). You may need to circle back to 2.1 to save
additional attributes when you converted the dataframe to a spatial object. 

* 3. Fine-tune your map: add a title, make sure the legend label makes sense, add a scale bar (google "add scale bar map ggplot" and choose your favorite package). All maps must always have a scale bar. You can add a N arrow as well, though some cartographers argue that is only necessary if N isn't at the top of the map.

* 4. Write a figure caption for your map explaining any interesting trends you see. 

* 5. Export you cropped layer to a .shp so you can use it again for your final project.

* 6. Push this lab to your github repo (just the .Rmd, don't push the data!)

We are looking forward to seeing the maps you create! 

# Excersize 2.6

For your final projects, you will likely need to come up with summary statistics that describes the areas around where bees are captured. 
1. Using the distribution of your chosen bee and the spatial layer you imported in 2.6, extract a meaningful summary statistics from your spatial layer within a buffer of 500, 750, and 1000 km.
2. Create a plot that illustrates this summary data (box plot, barplot, scatter plot, historgram). 
3. Create a map of your cropped spatial data.

```{r buffers}
tempavg_or2018_extract <- extract(x = tempavg_or_stack,y = location_apOBA, raw=FALSE)

tempavg_2019Extract <- extract( x = temp2019avg, y = location_apOBA, raw = FALSE)

summary(tempavg_or2018_extract)
summary(tempavg_2019Extract)
```

```{r}
temp2018_DF <- as.data.frame(tempavg_or2018_extract)
ggplot(data = temp2018_DF, aes(x = PRISM_ppt_stable_4kmM3_2018_bil)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 20) + 
  labs(x = 'July 2018 Temperature in Oregon', y = 'Frequency', title = 'Average Temperature in Oregon, July 2018')
```
```{r}
temp2019_DF <- as.data.frame(tempavg_2019Extract)
ggplot(data = temp2018_DF, aes(x = PRISM_tmean_stable_4kmM3_201907_bil))+
  geom_histogram(bins = 20) +
  labs(x = 'July 2019 Temperature in Oregon', y = 'Frequency', title = 'Average Temperature in Oregon, July 2019')
```
```{r}
pointA18 <- temp2018_DF[1, ] 
#mean_temp <- extract(x = tempavg_or_PROcropped,
               # y = st_buffer(pointA18, dist = 500),
               #fun = mean)
```

#summary(tempavg_or_PROcropped_df)
#Oregon bee data and what I am using for my project and plot them together. Push into get hub: Add, commit, push
```
