Title - The Yellow Faced Bombus and how the food supply changes seasonly throughout the state of Oregon.
1. Literature Review
  a) Introduce the problem and explain why
The Yellow Faced Bombus (Bombus vosnesenksii) is a pollinator that can be found up and down the west cost of 
North America to Bristish Columbia (iNaturalist). During seasonal changes of climate it is questioned what this bee 
does to surive the colder temperatures. The yellow faced bombus is the most active in the spring, this is due 
to the new colony of bees that will be arriving in the fall (Daane, 2023). Bombus vosnesenksii are not native to 
a certain location, but rather the Bombus vosnesenksii can be spotted in subarbs, grasslands, high elevation, and 
modified landscapes (Nature Serve Explorer). Because the bee has been spotted in numerous places in the west coast,
the temperature does vary and that effects the bumbus food supply and how the bumbus keep the colony alive and functioning (Strange et al. 2023). 
Thus, the interest is peeked on how the yellow faced bombus supports the colony in the midst of the changing vegitation along with
the vastly differing climate temperatues. 

  b) Past work and data available
James P. Strange addressed the issue of colony size changing with the climate conditions. Strange analized colony size from 2009 - 2019, 
he found that the colony size in the winter increases because the Bombus vosnesenksii produces more drone/ worker bees compaired to other 
species of bees. Through his research he was able to help conservationalist with different techniques, such as, utilizing T-tests to compair
two different speices and the nesting percentage. 

Data available 
For the colony size I could use the tables that Strange collected.
For the temperature there is an Oregon climate data website that has data of different averages of weather and parcipitation in the state of Oregon.

To collect data for the yellow faced bombus vegitation througout the different seasons.

  c) Purpose of the study
I will refine my data by combining the vegitation meta data and the location of the six specific flowers that the yellow faced bombus preferes.
I will also combine the colony count of the yellow bombus with the average temperatures of each season. This will be similar to the the map 
I made in the lab 5 homework. 
I will also plot which flower is preferred by the yellow faced bombus for each month of the year.

This will help communicate the scientific findings in a way the reader can understand if they have no background on the the yellow faced bombus 
and its food supply in the varying climates. The graphics can dipict the colony size in the winter and summer, and how the changing seasons 
changes the yellow faced bompus food preference. 

  d) Hypotheses/questions

It is questioned how the bee maintains the colony under varying weather conditions/season. It is hypothesized that 
the yellow faced bombus food supply will be inpacted in the winter seasons and how the diet changes as the vegitation 
of the landscape scape changes. I predict that the yellow faced bombus colony size will decrease as the weather decreases. I also predict 
that the food chain will have a paralleling relationship with the changing seasons, meaning, as winter appraches the vegitation differs and
yellow faced bompus prefered food/vegitation decreases. The whole goal is to see the differences in interaction between the bombus and food supply as the weather changes, also the difference in colony size 
as the weather and food supply changes. I am curious about the changes in weather and how it influcenes the bombus food chain and colony size. 

2. Dataset Identification
colony size is in a CSV file colony_size_database_2015_2018.csv - it was collected by James P Strange

3. Workflow Plan
1) Remove all the other coloneis of bees from the colony count 
2) Map out the weather averages in the state of california as well as overlay the identification spots of the yellow faced bombus on top
3) Overlay the weather averages of each season on the state of oregon and the amount of vegitation that appears for each flower the bompus prefers
4) Overlay the colony count of the bombus throughout the climate changes in california. 

My stratagy to exicute this will be similar to the lab project 5 and also I am hoping to make a food web network like displayed in lab project
